1	Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood	After a horrific alchemy experiment goes wrong in the Elric household, brothers Edward and Alphonse are left in a catastrophic new reality. Ignoring the alchemical principle banning human transmutation, the boys attempted to bring their recently deceased mother back to life. Instead, they suffered brutal personal loss: Alphonse's body disintegrated while Edward lost a leg and then sacrificed an arm to keep Alphonse's soul in the physical realm by binding it to a hulking suit of armor.\r\n\r\nThe brothers are rescued by their neighbor Pinako Rockbell and her granddaughter Winry. Known as a bio-mechanical engineering prodigy, Winry creates prosthetic limbs for Edward by utilizing "automail," a tough, versatile metal used in robots and combat armor. After years of training, the Elric brothers set off on a quest to restore their bodies by locating the Philosopher's Stone—a powerful gem that allows an alchemist to defy the traditional laws of Equivalent Exchange.\r\n\r\nAs Edward becomes an infamous alchemist and gains the nickname "Fullmetal," the boys' journey embroils them in a growing conspiracy that threatens the fate of the world.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]	9.1	Bones	NULL	Action, Adventure, Drama, Fantasy	64	24

Adding to the struggle, any in-game death becomes permanent, ending the player's life in the real world.\r\n\r\nWhile Kazuto "Kirito" Kirigaya was fortunate enough to be a beta-tester for the game, he quickly finds that despite his advantages, he cannot overcome SAO's challenges alone. Teaming up with Asuna Yuuki and other talented players, Kirito makes an effort to face the seemingly insurmountable trials head-on. But with difficult bosses and threatening dark cults impeding his progress, Kirito finds that such tasks are much easier said than done.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]	7.2	A-1 Pictures	Love Polygon, Video Game	Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Romance	25	23

But those who dwelt upon the land, through vanity, cunning and greed, attempted to build a multitude of towers whose tops reached unto heaven, and accumulated great wealth on earth. Scattering across the land and laying it to waste, man turned a deaf ear to His Voice. So He gave unto man an opportunity to atone for his misdeeds; and flame and smoke and the roar of a lion descended upon earth; and shattered the many towers to dust...." \n\n(Source: Production I.G Official Website) 	6.44	NULL	NULL	Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi	1	103

One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade.\n\nA consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)	7.21	Madhouse	NULL	Action, Adventure	26	23

If one is removed from its resting place, time will freeze in that area, so even evil Pokémon do not dare to steal them. But recently, anomalies in time have been appearing throughout the land, causing the appearance of Mystery Dungeons and violent Pokémon. Pokémon exploration teams have been formed to explore these Mystery Dungeons, arrest the violent Pokémon, and help maintain the peace.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that the anomalies in time have not been caused by the recent disappearance of the Time Gears, but by Temporal Tower slowly falling apart and Dialga corrupting into Dark Dialga. The newly infamous thief Juptile had stolen the Time Gears in order to take them to Temporal Tower and stop its deterioration. The Pokémon exploration team Team Pokédans—which consists of Hikozaru and a once-human Pochama—must team up with Juptile to go to the Phantom Land where Temporal Tower is located. If the trio fails, Temporal Tower will completely collapse, leaving the whole world frozen in time forever...\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]	6.65	OLM	NULL	Adventure, Fantasy	1	25

1324	Patalliro!	Patarillo! is set in a society much like ours in most ways, with one decided twist. The manga on which it is based is one of the much-read works produced for adolescent Japanese girls that features a healthy proportion of gay men and beautiful teenagers aka bishounen (beautiful boys). Most of the action takes place in Marinera, the land of eternal spring, located somewhere in the South Seas. The country is a major producer of diamonds; they provide much of the basis of conflict in the anime series. They come from one of the most prolific mines in the world, owned by the king of Marinera, the vertically challenged but horizontally endowed boy-king Patarillo himself. The International Diamond Syndicate - a huge semi- criminal organization/ secret society dedicated to taking over the world's entire diamond supply- wants that mine and will stop at nothing to get it. In the early episodes they send off a number of bishounen assassins to do in Patarillo, which necessitates his having a bodyguard, the English MI6 agent, Major Jack ('Bishounen-Killer') Bancoran. Bancoran's nickname doesn't mean he shoots bishounen in cold blood. The soubriquet comes from the fact that no male under the age of 17 can resist his sexual fascination. This, to Bancoran's eternal disgust, includes Patarillo himself. The action switches often from Marinera to MI6 headquarters in London (London seems to be an easy two hour's flight from the South Seas) or Bancoran's palatial condo in the suburbs of same. (MI6, be it noted, looks a lot like Fritz Lang's Metropolis, while Jack's 'apartment' bears a passing resemblance to Randolph Hearst's spread.) The action also goes into the past and future and out into space. Patarillo evidently gets around.\r\n\r\n(Source: aestheticism.com)	7.25	Toei Animation	NULL	Adventure, Boys Love, Comedy	49	24

An Umbrella scientist lost in all the confusion.

After commencing its mission of exploration, the starship Rugger-Guard is attacked by a ship of the Galbeston Empire. Dairugger, the super robot, is deployed in order to defend the Earth. It is somewhat by fate that they must help the people of Galbeston find a new planet before it explodes, and liberate it from its despotic Emperor. In the Japanese version, it does not have anything to do with King of the Beasts GoLion, as opposed to the U.S. version, Voltron: Defender of the Universe.\r\n\r\nThere are three assault team units: Land, Air, and Sea. There are a total of 15 parts referred to as "Rugger," which can combine together to form the super-robot Dairugger. The design of the 15 separate Rugger units came from the sport of rugby, since 15 players are required to form a rugby union. The U.S. version would rename the "Galbeston Empire" to "Drule Empire," along with editing a fair amount of violence and sexual content to keep the show safe for general audience broadcast.\r\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)\r\n\r\n	6.36	Toei Animation	Mecha, Space	Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi	52	25

However Tsukuyomi, an evil god who rules Yomi, succeeded in reaching the stones one after another, destroying 7 of the planets using his powerful robots, the Sky Warriors. However, when he tried to acquire the last stone from the planet Ismo, the most powerful Sky Warrior, Susanoo, got out of control and was blown away.\r\n\r\nA million years later, the Death Star Yomi is approaching the Onam System once again. Tsukuyomi, the master of Yomi, plans to take this opportunity to realize his dream of ruling the entire universe. He is desperate for the last stone containing Yamatano Orochi. If Tsukuyomi can get hold of this stone, Yamatano Orochi will return to life and its power will become his. Tsukuyomi needs Sky Warrior Susanoo to capture the stone, and sends 8 Sky Soldiers to get Susanoo back. But it is too late. Susanoo no longer belongs to Tsukuyomi. It belongs to Takeru, a 13-year-old boy from Earth, who happened to discover the buried robot Susanoo and woke it from its million-year-long sleep. Takeru becomes involved in the battle against the Sky Soldiers and their evil master, Tsukuyomi. Susanoo stands up to protect his friends and their planet.\r\n\r\n(Source: AnimeNfo)	6.64	Nippon Animation	Mecha, Space	Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Sci-Fi	37	24

2046	Kashi no Ki Mokku	This version of Pinocchio tells a story of an extremely gullible, naive and morally confused wooden doll brought to life by a mystical blue fairy. Pinocchio (Mokku) is characterized as having many character faults which he must learn to overcome in order to be worthy of being granted humanity. Some of these character faults include selfishness, rudeness, insensitivity, indolence, obstinacy, over- trusting, self-pity, stupidity, disobedience, compulsive lying, arrogance, greed, cowardice, recklessness, cruelty, foolishness and an inability to learn from mistakes.\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire series Pinocchio (Mokku), partly due to his own delinquency and repetitive disobedience, must undergo other costly ordeals of hardship and pain in which he is continuously tormented, persecuted, bullied, humiliated, tricked, ridiculed, ostracised, beaten, downtrodden and subjected to degrading and inhumane treatment. Its plain depiction of the austere reality of what it would be like to be literally subhuman growing up in a world of danger and hardship, makes this another good example of traditional Japanese stories, which teach moral observance through tough endurance.\r\n\r\n(Source: Wikipedia)	6.24	Tatsunoko Production	NULL	Adventure, Fantasy	52	24

The only other name among the staff that rings a bell, though, is Yukihide Takekawa, who was responsible for the music in the magnificent and unknown Unico pilot film. \n\nThe story takes some illogical and confusing jumps at the point where Aladdin begins to court the princess, and the extravagant animation that had characterised Toei films of the 60s, when Toei had the best animators around, had become a thing of the past long before this point; but this is still an above-average film, in large part because of the screenplay that stays so faithful to the original. The character designs are slightly more western-looking than one is accustomed to seeing in anime. \n\n(Source: pelleas.net)	6.16	Toei Animation	NULL	Adventure, Fantasy	1	65

2334	Anime Koukyoushi: Jungle Taitei	Actually, that 1991 date is misleading. The Symphonic Poem originated with the music Isao Tomita wrote for Jungle Emperor in 1965. He re-worked his music into a long form which tells a story by itself. (This form of music was termed "symphonic poem" or "tone poem" by composers in the late Romantic era.) So music that was written originally to enhance visual story telling became the story teller.\r\n\r\nTomita's symphonic poem was recorded in the mid-60s and issued on LP in Japan. More than once, in fact. It has also been on CD more than once.\r\n\r\nIn 1991, Tezuka Productions turned the process upside down and created new animation to illustrate the symphonic poem. The story is basically that of the first Kimba episode. We see the peaceful animal kingdom under Panja, the coming of the hunters, Eliza's capture and Panja's death. Kimba is born and escapes back to Africa. All this told without a single word spoken. The style of the Symphonic Poem's animation is unique. It draws heavily on the style of the 1989 TV series, but Kimba looks different from the way he looked in any other production.\r\n\r\n(Source: kimbawlion.com)	6.44	Madhouse	NULL	Adventure	1	51

While on Earth they travel in a tire-shaped vehicle capable of enormous speeds called the Big Wheel, which can travel on both land and water (and, with modifications, through the air).\n\nThe series tackles a number of issues which were surprisingly progressive for an animated cartoon of that period; particularly ecological concerns and poverty.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)	6.9	Mushi Production	NULL	Action, Adventure, Comedy, Sci-Fi	52	23

2583	Ginga Hyouryuu Vifam 13	On July 27 1996, Mr. Takeyuki Kanda died suddenly at the age of 52. Born August 11 1943, he was known as the director of several animations including VIFAM. Thus in 1998 a new TV series of VIFAM was broadcasted in memory of him. Televised 1998/3/21-1998/10/3 (in Kansai area), it contains 26 episodes, and like Twelve people disappeared it is a sidestory, but some new features are added: new persons, new RV, etc.\r\n\r\nThe story could be inserted between #22 and #26 (#24 and #25 are digests) of VIFAM, and is divided into three parts: Act I (#1-14), Interlude (#15-18), Act II (#19-26), if we name them (in reality Act I and II have little relationship). It could also be the New Testament, but it is now regarded as an apocrypha (or worse, a pseudo-VIFAM). There are several reasons to say so, but to watch the story is the best way to understand them.\r\n\r\n(Source: u-netsurf.ne.jp/~suemura/vifam/vguide.html)	6.47	Sunrise	NULL	Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi	26	24

3282	World End Economica	Yoshiharu Kawaura is part of the first generation of humans born on the Moon and has a wild dream: to be a part of the elite who live in the center of Lunar City. As a homeless teenage runaway with only meager savings and an irreverent attitude, he hides and sleeps in internet cafes while trading stocks on the Lunar Stock Exchange. With his hard work and natural intuition of the market, his seed money of one thousand mools grows to seventy-two thousand mools in a matter of months, with the end to his streak nowhere in sight.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, despite the Moon being an economic paradise with limited regulations and low taxes, street urchins like Yoshiharu must always remain on the lookout. After an especially close call with the police, he takes refuge in a church owned and ran by Risa, a part-time worker at a Chinese restaurant. In a stroke of fate, also staying at the church is Hagana, a cold girl with mean eyes and genius-level mathematical abilities. Yoshiharu—now assuming the pseudonym Haru—immediately sees Hagana's potential as a quantitative analyst and establishes a partnership with her for a virtual stock trading competition known to be a ticket into the financial community. As their growing success both in and out of the competition leads to more people investing in Haru and his goal, will he be able to keep his cool and stay on top of the ever-volatile market?\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]	\N	NULL	NULL	Adventure, Romance, Sci-Fi	1	0

If his deduction is true, no homicide took place. Everyone at the mansion is required to wait, and when the kids arrive, somebody has to entertain them. Mak recounts his life to them and he particularly emphasizes the closeness he had with his mother. From his days as a kid to his formative young adult years, she’s protected, given her sage advice and raised him like any mother would. She even tried to be a superhero, but an astronaut she is not. The metaphors are obvious, because the hospital she goes for that “space training” means she is ill. To a very young mind, to process certain situations can be tough.\r\n\r\nThe universal messages are understood. The Mak family was never rich. To see the two struggle through young McDull’s eyes is enduring and Chinese youths born outside of this country can get an understanding where their parents came from. \r\n\r\n(Source: Ed Sum from The Vintage Tempest)	\N	NULL	Anthropomorphic, Detective	Comedy	1	81

4481	In:App	Inside our small smart device is a world very much like our own, where countless Appmen work to run their apps as smoothly as possible. Each of our thoughtless taps or pretty selfies can easily drive Smart World into chaos. But the same goes the other way – when our smartphone malfunctions our days can easily be ruined. \r\n\r\nIn this oddly balanced back and forth – where what seems small in one world can become huge in the other – are our protagonists Jackie and Robin. These two don’t quite mesh. They are a team with no teamwork. They just don’t seem reliable enough for us to entrust our smart devices. But they do remind us that their, and our "Smart Life" can easily become comedy.\r\n\r\n(Source: WelCon)	\N	ANYZAC	NULL	Action, Comedy	56	7
